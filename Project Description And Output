# dice-game-analysis
You are hired by a fictional game company to analyze user data from their “Dice Game” app (launched in 2024 on browser and mobile). The task involves processing user, session, payment, and registration data using Python (Pandas or PySpark), transforming it into a local data warehouse/lake using Star Schema or Data Vault 2.0, and saving the output as CSV or Parquet files. You must include unit tests or data quality checks and extract key business insights such as the number of online vs mobile sessions, one-time vs subscription payments, and total revenue.

Scoring is based on:

50% for a complete, error-free application

30% for clean, modular, testable code

10% for future extensibility

10% for meaningful insights

STEPS I DID:  

I imported the necessary libraries like pandas and os. Then I loaded all the CSV files such as user, user registration, plan, user play sessions, and payment details into DataFrames. After loading, I merged relevant tables to create dimension tables like dim_user (which combines user and registration info), dim_plan (contains plan details), and dim_payment (has payment details).

Next, I created two fact tables: fact_play, which merges play sessions with channel and status information, and fact_user_plan, which combines user plans, payment, and plan info. I performed data quality checks to ensure there were no duplicate user IDs and handled missing values by filling them with 'Unknown'.

To generate insights, I checked how many game sessions happened on browser vs mobile. The result showed 941 sessions on browser and 931 on mobile, which means both platforms are equally popular. Then I checked how many users used onetime payment vs subscription plans, which came out almost evenly split (ONETIME: 75, MONTHLY: 74, ANNUALLY: 66). Finally, I calculated the total gross revenue from all user plans, which was $1,930.85.

At the end, I saved all processed dimension and fact tables into an output folder as CSV files for future analysis or reporting. The notebook runs completely without error and provides business insights the company can use to plan for 2025.
